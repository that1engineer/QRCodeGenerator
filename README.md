Follow these 3 steps to begin making your very own QR codes!

Step 1. Create a folder to contain your scripts, QR codes, and any pictures you want the QR codes to contain.
Step 2. Install python's "QRCode" package and its dependency "pillow" by typing the following command in your terminal: pip install "qrcode[pil]"
Step 3. In "MyQRCodeTemplate.py", adjust the variables as desired and begin generating your very own QR codes!

Note:
If you use VS Code, make sure you open the folder the script is in, or it will not be able to access the QRCodeGenerator script or images you select.
